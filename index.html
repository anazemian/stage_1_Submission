          <p>
            HTML stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b>. The web works in conjuction with HTML, sending a request via http through the internet to a server that processes that request.
          </p>
          <p>
           The server then finds the appropriate <em>HTML</em> document and sends it back to the users computer where a browser such as <em>Google Chrome</em> will display that document in a user friendly manner for the person using the internet.

          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              HTML is made of 3 basic parts. These parts are as follows:<br>
            </p>  
              <ul>
                  <li>Text content: <b>what you see</b></li>
                  <li>Mark-up: <b>what it looks like</b></li>
                  <li>References to other documents:<b> i.e. images and videos</b></li>

                <p>
                  HTML is made up of what is called <em>HTML Elements</em>. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. These tags are capable of doing such things as adding images and <a href="http://www.reddit.com">links</a> on our webpage.<br>
                  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/QzVErF6.png" alt="BigBoss"><br>Tags also help design the webpage with attributes like writing in <b>bold</b> or <i>italics</i>.

                  <p>
                    We also learn the difference between <em>inline and block elements</em>.<br> <b>Inline</b> does not create a new block of content, such as the span tag, or the break tag, where as <b>Block</b> will create a new block of content, such as the paragraph tag, or the div tag. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.

                      Finally, we also learn computers are "stupid". Not in the sense that they cannot complete simple tasks, but in that the smallest mistake can cause the biggest of issues. However, if we learn how to speak/code correctly, we can make computers do amazing things.

                        Using a browser such as chrome will allow you to open the developer tools and see the code for any website. Within these developer tools, you can see the <em>Document Object Model</em> or <b>DOM</b>. The DOM is the tree like structure that is the breakdown of the HTML elements. If it were to be drawn out on paper, it would be like seeing the family tree of a website.

                        HTML, CSS, and Java/js, all work together to create a more structured webpage. If thought of together in the context of a house, HTML would be the frame or the walls, CSS would be the paint and decorations, and js would be the TV remote, or garage door opener. These three work together to make one cohesive home, or in this case, website that allows the site to be user friendly. The more these elements work together, the more fluid and smooth the experience will be for the end user.

                      The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. You can draw this relationship like a family tree. 
                      In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes, etc...
                    </p>
                      <p>
                        When you read an HTML document as text, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding "box" is.

                        Avoiding repetition

                        It is very important for numerous reasons we avoid repetition.<br><br>
                        <b><em>Avoiding Errors:</em></b> When programmers <b>don't</b> avoid repetition, they often have to do the same things over and over. This may result in copy and pasting certain style attributes into many HTML elements, or rewriting the same code, perhaps sometimes with a very slight difference, many times over. This can lead to errors when the programer decides to make a change. If they don't make that same change <b>everywhere</b> the repeated code appears, it will lead to problems.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <b><em>Consistency:</em></b> When we avoid repetition, and work smarter, we can make changes at a much quicker rate, rather than maunally making a change to every section of our code.

                      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.

                    There are three ways to add CSS to your work.<br><br>
                    <b>Writing CSS into your head element.</b>  This is good for smaller projects.<br><br>
                    <b>Link HTML to a separate CSS file.</b> This adds an extra step to the process but is more organized for a larger project.<br><br>
                    <b>Inline with code.</b> This is generally a bad idea as it leads to a lot of repetion in coding.
